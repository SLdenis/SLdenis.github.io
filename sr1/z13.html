	<p align="center"> <br>When everyone you thought you knew<br>
Deserts your fight, I'll go with you<br>
You're facin' down a dark hall<br>
I'll grab my light<br>br
And go with you, I'll go with you<br>
I'll go with you, I'll go with you<br>
I'll go with you, I'll go with you<br>
I'll go with you, I'll go with you<br>
Surrounded and up against a wall<br>
I'll shred 'em all and go with you<br>
When choices end, you must defend<br>
I'll grab my bat<br>
And go with you, I'll go with you<br>
I'll go with you, I'll go with you, yeah<br>
Stay with me, no, you don't need to run<br>
Stay with me, my blood, you don't need to run<br>
Stay with me, no, you don't need to run<br>
Stay with me, my blood, you don't need to run<br>
If there comes a day<br>
People posted up at the end of your driveway<br>
They're callin' for your head and they're callin' for your name<br>
I'll bomb down on 'em, I'm comin' through<br>
Do they know I was grown with you?<br>
If they're here to smoke, know I'll go with you<br>
Just keep it outside, keep it outside, yeah<br>
Stay with me, no, you don't need to run<br>
Stay with me, my blood, you don't need to run<br>
Stay with me, no, you don't need to run<br>
Stay with me, my blood, you don't need to run<br>
You don't need to run<br>
(Ooh ooh, ooh ooh<br>
You don't need to run<br>
(Ooh ooh, ooh ooh)<br>
You don't need to run<br>
(Ooh ooh, ooh ooh)<br>
You don't need to run<br>
If you find yourself in a lion's den<br>
I'll jump right in and pull my pin<br>
And go with you, I'll go with you<br>
I'll go with you, I'll go with you (You don't need to run)<br>
I'll go with you, I'll go with you (You don't need to run)<br>
I'll go with you<br>
My blood, I'll go with you, yeah<br>
Stay with me, no, you don't need to run<br>
Stay with me, my blood, you don't need to run<br>
Stay with me, no, you don't need to run<br>
Stay with me, my blood, you don't need to run<br>
You don't need to run<br>
(Ooh ooh, ooh ooh)<br>
You don't need to run
(Ooh ooh, ooh ooh)<br>
You don't need to run<br>
(Ooh ooh, ooh ooh)<br>
You don't need to run<br>
Stay with me, no, you don't need to run<br>
Stay with me, my blood</p>
